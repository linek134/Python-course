This folder contains my answers to exercises for day 4
##1. Testing code with py.test:

My code for testing the functions in simple_math.py is in test_simple_math.py
Output is in test_out.txt


##2. Documenting code

simple_math.py contains the code with docstrings
subfolder docs contains the output files from Sphinx


##3. Plotting with matplotlib

customized_plotting.ipynb contains an additional cell with my code for generating a scatter plot.
The file my_fancy_plot_custom.pdf contains the same plot.
Unfortunately I ran out of time and didnÂ´t finish the last exercise.
